## Task:
- Generate a string with N opening brackets (“[”) and N closing brackets (“]”), in some arbitrary order.
- Determine whether the generated string is balanced; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.

## Examples:
   (empty)   OK
   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
